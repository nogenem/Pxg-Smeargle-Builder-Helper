  A couple of helpers to... help you make a better decision about which moves to use on your Smeargle.
</h4>

## The problem

["Building"](https://wiki.pokexgames.com/index.php/Tutoriais:Smeargle) a new [Smeargle](https://wiki.pokexgames.com/index.php/Smeargle) is an annoying task that you really have to think about, or just copy other people's work haha.

## The solution

So, to help me and my friend to make a better decision about this pokemon's moves, i thought about a way to see which elements were the best to hunt in Outland/Phenac and which moves from each element were possible in each position.

## Requirements
- [PokeXGames](https://www.pokexgames.com/#/home)
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nogenem/Pxg-Smeargle-Builder-Helper.git
```

2. Enter the right folder:
```bash
cd Pxg-Smeargle-Builder-Helper/
```

3. Install the dependencies:
 ```bash
yarn install
```

4. Configure what you want to run in the `index.js`'s `ACTIONS` object.

5. Start the system:
 ```bash
yarn start
```
